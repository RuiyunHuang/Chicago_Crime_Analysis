##**I have been living in Chicago for 5 years. Crime in Chicago is a also very interesting and also common topic for exploration. Though I am quite indoor person who may not be able to feel the crime situation, City of Chicago provides a very neat and detailed data on [Chicago Data Portal] (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2019/w98m-zvie). Data from 2016 to present is used to explore what happenned in the past year I lived here.**
