**Motivation:**

I have been living in Chicago for 5 years. Crime in Chicago is also a very interesting topic for exploration. Though I am a quiet indoor person who may not be able to feel the crime situation, the City of Chicago provides a very neat and detailed data on [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2019/w98m-zvie). Data from 2016 to present is used for exploration.**

The goal of this project is for self-interests and not sophisticated and intensive data analysis but data visualization using popular tools recent days and time series analysis for prediction on future.
